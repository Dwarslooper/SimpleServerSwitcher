# SimpleServerSwitcher
Command-based server switcher with restriction options (permission based)

Created as part of a commission

##Commands
  - ssreload: Reloads the plugin / listed servers

When updating the config, you might need to rejoin because of how commands work. I didn't want to manually update the commands packet-based for all players.
